# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Analyzing employees of the company to determine how big of an impact the silver-tsunami will have on the company.

## Results
* The role that will lose the most people is that of Senior Engineer.
* The the role that is a close second is Senior Staff.
* The roles that will suffer the least are those in management - Technique Leaders and Managers.
* 1,549 people will be eligible for the new mentorship program.

## Summary
In total 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the silver tsunami begins. However, there is also major trouble in that there are only 1,549 people available to help mentor the coming generation. In order to help anticipate this problem the company should strongly consider begining to fill these roles now while it can utilize current retirees as mentors.
